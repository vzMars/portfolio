## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS

This application was made using React and TypeScript. Tailwind CSS was used to style this application. This application is also mobile responsive and renders different components depending if the user is on a mobile or desktop device. React Router DOM was used to handle routing in this application. I have also created a 404 Not Found page for routes that don't exist in the application.
